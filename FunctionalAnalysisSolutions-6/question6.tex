Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $M$ be a closed subspace of $H$. Let $P_M$ be the orthogonal projection onto $M.$ Suppose $T\in \mathcal B(H).$ Show that $M$ is an invariant subspace for $T$ if and only if $TP_M = P_MTP_M.$ Show that $M$ is a reducing subspace for $T$ if and only if $P_MT=TP_M.$

\begin{proof}
    Let $P_{M}$ be the orthogonal projection onto the closed subspace $M$ and let $T\in \calB \left( H \right)$. First, we show that if $x \in M$ then $Px =x$.

    We wish to show that $M$ is an invariant subspace of $T$ iff $TP_{M}=P_{M}TP_{M}$.

    \begin{description}
	\item[$\left( \Longrightarrow \right)$] Suppose that $M$ is an invariant subspace of $T$, that is, $TM \subset M$. We wish to show that $TP_{M} = P_{M}TP_{M}$.

	    First, we show that if $x\in M$ then $P_{M}x=x$. To show this, let $x\in M$. Then by the decomposition of Hilbert space by a closed subspace, we have that
	    \begin{equation*}
		x=P_{M}x + P_{M^{\perp}}x
	    \end{equation*}
	    but then $x-P_{M}x \in M \cap M^{\perp} = \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Thus, we must have that $x=P_{M}x$.

	    Now, let $x\in M$ then we have that $TP_{M}x \in M$ because $P_{M}x \in M$ and therefore, we have that $TP_{M}x \in M$. By what we just proved we have that $TP_{M}x = P_{M}TP_{M}x$. Since $x\in H$ was arbitrary, we have that $TP_{M} = P_{M} TP_{M}$.
	\item[$\left( \Longleftarrow \right)$] Suppose that $TP_{M}=P_{M}TP_{M}$. Let $x\in M$. Then we have that $P_Mx =x$ by what we proved earlier. Thus, we have that $Tx=P_{M}TP_{M}x \in M$.
    \end{description}
    This completes the proof.
