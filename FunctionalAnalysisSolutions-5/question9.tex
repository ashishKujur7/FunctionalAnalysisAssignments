\section{Question 9}
\horz

Let $X$ be an infinite dimensional normed linear space and $S= \{ x\in X : \|x\|=1\}$ be the unit sphere in $X.$ Show that  if $y\in X$ with $\|y\| \leqslant 1,$ then every weak neighbourhood of $y$ must intersect $S.$ Finally show that weak closure of $S$ is equal to the closed unit Ball $B= \{x\in X : \|x\| \leqslant 1 \}.$

\begin{proof}
    We proceed to show that if $y \in X$ with $\norm{y} \le 1$ and $U$ is a weak neighbourhood of $y$ then $U \cap S \ne \emptyset$.
\end{proof}
