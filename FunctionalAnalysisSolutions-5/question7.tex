\section{Question 7}
\horz

Suppose $X$ is a finite dimensional normed linear space. Then show that the weak topology on $X$ and the norm topology on $X$ coincides.

\horz
\begin{proof}
    It is clear that the norm topology contains the norm topology. To show the reverse inclusion, we show that every open ball contains a basis element of the weak topology.

    Consider the open ball $B\left( 0,1 \right)$. Suppose that $X$ is of dimension $n$. Consider the linear functionals $f_{i} (x) = x_{i}$ for each $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$. Then it is easy to see that $\cap_{i=1}^{n} f_{i}^{-1} \left( B\left( 0, 1/2 \right) \right) \subset B(0,1)$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}
