\section{Question 7}
\horz

Suppose $X$ is a finite dimensional normed linear space. Then show that the weak topology on $X$ and the norm topology on $X$ coincides.

\horz
\begin{proof}[Proof (sketch).]
    It is clear that the norm topology contains the norm topology. To show the reverse inclusion, we show that every open ball contains a basis element of the weak topology.

    Consider the open ball $B\left( 0,1 \right)$. Suppose that $X$ is of dimension $n$. Consider the linear functionals $f_{i} (x) = x_{i}$ for each $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$. Then it is easy to see that $\cap_{i=1}^{n} f_{i}^{-1} \left( B\left( 0, 1/2 \right) \right) \subset B(0,1)$. This completes the proof. Since weak topology is translation invariant, we are done. 

(To show that the weak topology is translation invariant, show that the translation map maps the subbasis element to a subbasis.)
\end{proof}
