Let $T : \ell^2(\mathbb N) \to \ell^2(\mathbb N)$ be the linear map given by $T \Big((x_j)_{j\in\mathbb N}\Big) = \Big ( (\frac{x_j}{j})_{j\in \mathbb N}\Big).$ 

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Show that $T$ is continuous and injective.
\item[2.] Consider the map $T^{-1} : range (T) \to \ell^2(\mathbb N)$ given by $T^{-1}(Tf) =f$ for $f\in \ell^2(\mathbb N).$ Show that $T^{-1}$ is not continuous.
\item[3.] Conclude that $range (T)$ is not closed in $\ell^2(\mathbb N).$  
\end{itemize}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item This is clear from Holder's inequality.
	\item Let $k > 0$. Select $N \in \N$ such that $k < N$. Consider the sequence
	    \begin{align*}
		N=\norm{T^{-1}\left( \frac{e_{N}}{N} \right)} > k \norm{e_{N}}
	    \end{align*}
    This shows that $T$ is discontinuous.
\item If $\im T$ was closed then the Banach isomorphism theorem would tell us that $T^{-1} : \im T \to \ell ^{2} \left( \N \right)$ is continuous which would contradict item 2.
    
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
