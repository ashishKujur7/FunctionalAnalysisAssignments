Let $T\in \mathcal B(H)$ and $T^*T=TT^*.$ Suppose that $T^k=0$ for some $k\in \mathbb N.$ Then show that $T=0.$

\begin{proof}
    Let $T$ be a normal operator. Then we have that $\sigma \left( T \right) \subset \R$. If $T^{k} = 0$ for some $k\in \N$ then we have that $\sigma\left( T^{k} \right)= \left( \sigma\left( T \right) \right)^{k} = \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Let $\lambda \in \sigma \left( T \right)$. Then we have that $\lambda ^{k} = 0$ implies $\lambda = 0$. This shows that $\sigma (T) = \left\{ 0 \right\}$ because spectrum is nonempty.

    Since $T$ is normal, we have that $\norm{T} = r\left( \rho \left( T \right) \right)=0$. Thus, we have that $T=0$.
\end{proof}
